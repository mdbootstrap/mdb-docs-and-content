        <p>We will go through the following steps:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Create a MySQL database named <code>todo_app</code></li>
          <li>Create Laravel project</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Let's go!</p>

        <h3>Creating MySQL database</h3>
        <p>In order to create a new database you need to run the following command:</p>
        <mdbsnippet>
          <code data-lang="shell" data-name="Shell">
            $ mdb database init -db mysql8
          </code>
        </mdbsnippet>
        <p>
          Now you need to provide your user data and then the database details. Please provide the
          values of your choice. For example:
        </p>
        <pre><code>? Enter username thor
? Enter password Mjolnir_1
? Repeat password Mjolnir_1
? Enter database name todo_app
? Enter description Database for the TODO app
</code></pre>
        <p class="note note-warning">
          <strong>Note:</strong> the password must contain <i>at least</i> one uppercase letter, one
          lowercase letter, one number, one special symbol and have minimum length of 8.
        </p>

        <p>Hit <kbd>Enter</kbd> and it's done.</p>

        <p>
          Please notice that in the command output the username and database name slightly differs
          from what you provided earlier. Don't worry - it's OK. A few random characters have been
          added to these values to randomize them and improve security of your database credentials.
        </p>
        <p class="note note-danger">
          <strong>Important:</strong> Do not close your terminal window until you save your
          credentials somewhere. This is the only time we will show you your database password. If
          you won't save it you'll loose it.
        </p>

        <h3>Creating Laravel project</h3>
        <p>In order to initialize and use predefined Laravel starter run the following command:</p>
        <!--prettier-ignore-->
        <mdbsnippet>
              <code data-lang="shell" data-name="Shell">
                  $ mdb backend init
              </code>
          </mdbsnippet>
        <p>and choose <code>Laravel starter</code> from the list that shows up.</p>
        <p>
          After initialization just go to the newly created project directory and open the
          <code>.env</code> file. After that edit the config values that start with
          <code>DB_</code>. You should make use of credentials that's been shown to you in the
          previous step. In my case the updated values look like this:
        </p>
        <pre><code>DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=mysql.db.mdbgo.com
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=todo_app48a0ca47
DB_USERNAME=thor83ad51bf
DB_PASSWORD=Mjolnir_1
</code></pre>

        <p>
          The starter project is ready to use. You don't have to change anything to run the example
          app for the sake of this tutorial. Simply publish it using the following command:
        </p>
        <mdbsnippet>
          <code data-lang="shell" data-name="Shell">
            $ mdb publish -p php-laravel
          </code>
        </mdbsnippet>

        <p>
          After your files get uploaded you can access your app under the address shown in the
          output.
        </p>

          <a href="https://mdbgo.com/docs/tutorials/node/">the tutorial</a> where we explain in
          detail what can go wrong here and how to deal with it.
        </p>

        <p class="note note-warning">
          <strong>Note:</strong> Since we need to install dependencies and run your app, it may take
          a few moments until it will be available under the provided URL.
