          Many people think that when you use Node.js you <i>have to</i> use MongoDB for storing
          data. <strong>But that's not true.</strong> You can use any kind of storage - it simply
          depends on your use case. In this tutorial we will show you how to create a Node.js API
          with MySQL database.

        <p>Here's a quick recap what are the main technologies used in this tutorial:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>MySQL</strong> is an open-source relational database management system. If you
            want to learn more about it check out a
            <a href="/docs/standard/cli/getting-started/mysql/" target="_blank">separate tutorial</a
            >.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Express.js</strong> is a web framework built for Node.js that allows you to
            create web servers in a very convenient way. Learn more about it
            <a href="https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/standard/cli/getting-started/express/">here</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Node.js</strong> is a multi-platform JavaScript runtime built on V8 engine. It's
            used as a backend side of web apps. Read more about it
            <a href="/docs/standard/cli/getting-started/node/">here</a>.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          We won't dive deep into details about how to get started with these technologies using MDB
          GO. Go ahead and check the linked tutorials and once you learn a few things get back here.
        </p>
        <p>If you have enough knowledge to get started, let's do this.</p>

    <h2 class="mb-4">Building the API</h2>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-12">
        <p>
          Our example app will be a TODO list. It's a very popular use-case so let's simply get
          things done one at a time. We will go through the following steps:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Create a MySQL database named <code>todo_app</code></li>
          <li>Create Node.js API with Express and Sequelize</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Let's go!</p>

        <h3>Creating MySQL database</h3>
        <p>In order to create a new database you need to run the following command:</p>
        <mdbsnippet>
          <code data-lang="shell" data-name="Shell">
            $ mdb database init -db mysql8
          </code>
        </mdbsnippet>
        <p>
          Now you need to provide your user data and then the database details. Please provide the
          values of your choice. For example:
        </p>
        <pre><code>? Enter username thor
? Enter password Mjolnir_1
? Repeat password Mjolnir_1
? Enter database name todo_app
? Enter description Database for the TODO app
</code></pre>
        <p class="note note-warning">
          <strong>Note:</strong> the password must contain <i>at least</i> one uppercase letter, one
          lowercase letter, one number, one special symbol and have minimum length of 8.
        </p>

        <p>Hit <kbd>Enter</kbd> and it's done.</p>

        <p>
          Please notice that in the command output the username and database name slightly differs
          from what you provided earlier. Don't worry - it's OK. A few random characters have been
          added to these values to randomize them and improve security of your database credentials.
        </p>
        <p class="note note-danger">
          <strong>Important:</strong> Do not close your terminal window until you save your
          credentials somewhere. This is the only time we will show you your database password. If
          you won't save it you'll loose it.
        </p>

        <p>
          That's pretty much it. You can now see how to connect with this database from the Node.js
          API.
        </p>

        <h3>Creating Node.js API with Express and Sequelize</h3>
        <p>
          In case you don't know, Sequelize is an object-relational mapper (<strong>ORM</strong>)
          built for Node.js. It helps managing MySQL access and translates the database results into
          easy-to-use objects. You can initialize a MDB GO starter that already has configured
          Sequelize. Simply run the following command:
        </p>
        <mdbsnippet>
          <code data-lang="shell" data-name="Shell">
            $ mdb backend init
          </code>
        </mdbsnippet>
        <p>and choose <code>Express.js + MySQL API starter</code> from the list that shows up.</p>
        <p>
          After initialization just go to the newly created project directory and open the
          <code>.env</code> file. After that edit the <code>DB_CONNECTION_STRING</code> value. You
          should paste the connection string that's been shown to you in the previous step. In my
          case the updated value looks like this:
        </p>
        <pre><code>DB_CONNECTION_STRING=mysql://thor83ad51bf:Mjolnir_1@mysql.db.mdbgo.com:3306/todo_app48a0ca47</code></pre>
        <p>Save the file and close it.</p>
        <p>
          The starter project is ready to use. You don't have to change anything to run the example
          app for the sake of this tutorial. Simply publish it using the following command:
        </p>
        <mdbsnippet>
          <code data-lang="shell" data-name="Shell">
            $ mdb publish -p node12
          </code>
        </mdbsnippet>

        <p>
          After your files get uploaded you can access your app under the address shown in the
          output.
        </p>

        <p class="note note-danger">
          <strong>Note:</strong> You may want to check
          <a href="/docs/standard/cli/getting-started/node/">the tutorial</a> where we explain in
          detail what can go wrong here and how to deal with it.
        </p>

        <p class="note note-warning">
          <strong>Note:</strong> Since we need to install dependencies and run your app, it may take
          a few moments until it will be available under the provided URL.
        </p>

        <p>Alright, let's see how to "talk" with our fresh API.</p>

        <section id="playing-with-api">
          <!-- Section title -->
          <h2 class="mb-4">Playing with Node.js API - CRUD requests</h2>

          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-12">
              <p>
                Before we jump into "talking" stuff, firstly let's find out what endpoints do we
                have.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the <code>./app/routes/tasks.js</code> file there are a few endpoints defined to
                show you how to get started.
              </p>
              <p>
                By default on the <code>/</code> route there is the <code>index.html</code> file
                served (located in <code>./public/</code> folder). There are also four additional
                endpoints defined:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <code>GET /tasks</code> - reads the <code>tasks</code> array and sends it as a
                  response
                </li>
                <li>
                  <code>POST /tasks</code> - creates a new task and appends it to the
                  <code>tasks</code> array
                </li>
                <li><code>PUT /tasks/:taskId</code> - updates a specific task</li>
                <li><code>DELETE /tasks/:taskId</code> - deletes a specific task</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                And these are the ones we are going to talk to. In order to do that I recommend you
                install some REST client - like Postman for example - because it'll make your life
                way easier. Alternatively, you can utilize <code>curl</code> command available in
                Linux/MacOS terminals. However, in this tutorial we will go with Postman.
              </p>
              <p>
                Go ahead and install it using
                <a
                  href="https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/installation-and-updates/"
                  target="_blank"
                  >official docs</a
                >.
              </p>

              <h3>Talking to our API</h3>
              <p>
                Once you download and install Postman you can start making requests. We will cover
                all of the above requests.
              </p>

              <h4>GET</h4>
              <p>
                In order to make a GET request you need to create a new request in Postman and do
                two things:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>First, select the request method - GET</li>
                <li>
                  Then provide the request URL. In our case it's going to be:
                  <code>https://express-starter.mdbgo.io/tasks</code>
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                Once you hit <code>Send</code> you will see the response - an empty array. Let's add
                an item there.
              </p>

              <h4>POST</h4>
              <p>
                In order to create a task we need to make a POST request. In order to do that you
                need to:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Select the request method - POST</li>
                <li>Provide request URL: <code>https://express-starter.mdbgo.io/tasks</code></li>
                <li>
                  Click the <i>Body</i> tab and select <i>raw</i> |
                  <i>JSON (application/json)</i> and provide the following content:
                  <pre><code>{
"name": "Do laundry",
"desc": "Boring but necessary..."
}</code></pre>
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                Once you hit <code>Send</code> you will see the response - a new task with
                <code>id</code> 1. Go ahead and run the <code>GET</code> request again to see it.
                Now let's try to update it.
              </p>

              <h4>PUT</h4>
              <p>Updating the task requires the following steps:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Select the request method - PUT</li>
                <li>
                  Provide the request URL: <code>https://express-starter.mdbgo.io/tasks/1</code>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Click the <i>Body</i> tab and select <i>raw</i> |
                  <i>JSON (application/json)</i> and provide the following content:
                  <pre><code>{
"name": "Do ironing",
"desc": "Boring but necessary... and also quite dangerous!"
}</code></pre>
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                Once you hit <code>Send</code> you will see the <code>OK</code> response. Go ahead
                and run the <code>GET</code> request again to see it. Alright, let's delete it.
              </p>

              <h4>DELETE</h4>
              <p>In order to delete a task you need to do the following:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Select the request method - DELETE</li>
                <li>
                  Provide the request URL: <code>https://express-starter.mdbgo.io/tasks/1</code>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Do not</strong> provide any body. Select <i>none</i> in the
                  <i>Body</i> tab.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                Once you hit <code>Send</code> you will see the <code>OK</code> response - it means
                the task has been deleted. If you run the <code>GET</code> request again you will
                see that the task is gone.
              </p>
