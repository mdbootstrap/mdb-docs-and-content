The following repository contains content of the mdbootstrap.com website, especially documentation. 

Within the root folder you can find two main languages - English and Chineese (simplified) (to be translated). 

Next level defines technology (jQuery, Angular, React and Vue). 3rd level defines platform - web or mobile (note: currently MDB is available as a web development framework, we are builing a Native version of MDB dedicated to mobile apps).

Finally 5th and 6th level defines categories and specific components. Please note that the folder strcuture corresponds with URL i.e.:
